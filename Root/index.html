		<h1> Life News Report</h1>
		<p> Committing to a fitness regimen means mapping out a plan for an activity or a series of activities that can be done with consistency. For some people, it is common to become energized about working out and jump right in. In these cases, unless there is a long-term plan in place or some thought has gone into how the fitness activity will be sustained, there is often a drop off in enthusiasm, resulting in inconsistency.
		</p>

		<p>A well thought out fitness plan will go a long way in helping you to reach your goals. To achieve consistency, you will want to think about the types of exercise that you can do on a regular basis. You will want to exercise at least three to four times per week for the best results. Getting a gym membership, purchasing home exercise equipment, investing in exercise DVDs or buying a bicycle may be some of the things you want or need to work out with consistency.
